# Google-Play-Store-App-Quality-Monitoring-using-Data-Analytics-Techniques
Everyday, a number of apps are added on the Google Play Store. Some of these apps are liked by people while others are not. For Android application developers, it is important to know what kind of apps are liked more by the people and what kind of apps are trending. These can be understood by properly analysing the statistics such as price of the app, supported Android versions, which Android version is used most widely, which apps are installed the most by people, ratings, etc. This work covers these and more for an appropriate study of Google Play Store which is also useful from application developersâ€™ point of view.
